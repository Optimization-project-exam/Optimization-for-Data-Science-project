# Optimization for Data Science project: Anomaly Detection

This is an exam project of Optimization for Data Science made by /m-pernini, /ir-ca, /FrancescoSart and /MarcoFurlan99.
In this project we analyze the problem of Anomaly Detection. We 
address the task using two algorithms that compute (1+Ïµ)-approximation
to Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) and since they are closely related to
the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm, we first focus on the Away-step FW
and the Pairwise FW algorithms. Then we choose 2 different datasets:
one with more instances than attributes, and one viceversa. On these, we
test the two MEB algorithms both on performance and on their capability
in finding anomalies.
We use Python as programming language.
